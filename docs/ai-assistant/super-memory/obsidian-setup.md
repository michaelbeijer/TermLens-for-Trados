description: Setting up Obsidian for your memory banks

# Obsidian Setup

Memory banks store all knowledge as Markdown files, which you can browse and edit with any text editor. For the best experience, we recommend [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) -- a free knowledge-base app that visualises the links between your articles as an interactive graph.

## Installing Obsidian

1. Download Obsidian from [https://obsidian.md/download](https://obsidian.md/download) (available for Windows, Mac, and Linux)
2.  Install and open it -- choose **Open folder as vault** and select one of your memory bank folders, for example:

    ```
    C:\Users\{you}\Supervertaler\memory-banks\default\
    ```

    If you keep several banks side by side, you can open each one as its own Obsidian vault and switch between them from Obsidian's vault switcher.
3. The free version of Obsidian includes everything you need -- no subscription required. (The paid Sync and Publish add-ons are not needed.)

## Web Clipper

The [Obsidian Web Clipper](https://obsidian.md/clipper) is a free browser extension that lets you clip web pages directly into a memory bank's inbox. Install it for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge.

### Setting up the Web Clipper

1. Install the extension from [obsidian.md/clipper](https://obsidian.md/clipper)
2. Make sure Obsidian is running with the memory bank you want to clip into open as a vault
3. Click the Web Clipper icon in your browser toolbar, then the gear icon (settings)
4. Create a new template (e.g. "memory-bank") and set:
   * **Note location:** `00_INBOX`
   * **Vault:** select the memory bank vault you want clippings to land in
5. Optionally add properties: `source_url` = `{{url}}`, `clipped` = `{{date}}`

Now when you find a useful reference -- a client style guide, a terminology resource, a domain article -- click the clipper, hit save, and it drops straight into that bank's inbox. Next time you click **[Process Inbox](process-inbox.md)** with that bank active in the toolbar, the AI organises it into structured articles.

If you keep several memory banks, create one Web Clipper template per bank so you can choose the destination from the clipper dropdown at clip time.
{% endhint %}

## Recommended plugins

These free Obsidian community plugins enhance the memory bank experience:

* **Dataview** -- query your vault like a database (e.g. list all terminology articles for a specific client)
* **Calendar** -- visualise when articles were created or modified
* **Graph Analysis** -- enhanced graph view with clustering and statistics

To install plugins: **Settings → Community plugins → Browse**.
