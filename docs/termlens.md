# TermLens

TermLens is an inline terminology display that shows the source text of the current segment word by word, with glossary translations directly underneath each matched term. It updates automatically when you navigate to a new segment.

## How It Works

When you select a segment in the Trados editor, TermLens analyses the source text against all active termbases and displays the result in a visual layout:

* **Matched words** appear with their glossary translation underneath, on a coloured background
* **Unmatched words** are shown in light grey text so you can read the full source sentence in context

This gives you an at-a-glance overview of every term in the segment that has a termbase entry – without hovering or clicking anything.

## Colour Coding

TermLens uses four background colours to distinguish term types:

| Colour     | Hex       | Meaning                                  |
| ---------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Blue**   | `#C8E6F5` | Regular Supervertaler termbase match     |
| **Pink**   | `#E6D7D8` | Project termbase match (higher priority) |
| **Yellow** | `#FFF3D0` | Non-translatable term (source = target)  |
| **Green**  | `#D4EDDA` | MultiTerm termbase match (`.sdltb`)      |

{% hint style="info" %}
Designate one termbase as the **Project termbase** in settings to make its terms appear in pink. Project terms take visual priority over regular terms, making it easy to spot client-specific terminology.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
**MultiTerm termbases** attached to your Trados project appear automatically as green chips. They are read-only – to edit MultiTerm terms, use Trados's built-in MultiTerm interface. See [MultiTerm Support](multiterm-support.md) for details.
{% endhint %}

## Inserting Terms

### Click to Insert

Click any translation shown under a source word. The translation is inserted at the cursor position in the target field.

### Keyboard Shortcuts (Alt+1 through Alt+9)

Each matched term in TermLens is assigned a **numbered badge**. Press **Alt+1** to insert the first match, **Alt+2** for the second, and so on up to **Alt+9**.

### Two-Digit Chord (Terms 10+)

For terms numbered 10 and above, use a quick two-key chord:

* **Alt+n+n** (pressed quickly) inserts term 11
* **Alt+1+2** inserts term 12
* **Alt+2+3** inserts term 23

The first digit is the tens place, the second is the ones place.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Alt+0** is reserved and cannot be used for term insertion. TermLens numbering starts at 1.
{% endhint %}

### Term Picker (Ctrl+Shift+G)

For segments with many matches, press **Ctrl+Shift+G** to open the **Term Picker** dialog. It shows all matched terms in a searchable list and lets you insert any term with a double-click or Enter.

## Right-Click Context Menu

Right-click any term in TermLens to access:

| Action                       | Description                                                                        |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Edit Term**                | Open the term editor to modify source, target, or metadata                         |
| **Delete Term**              | Remove the term from the termbase                                                  |
| **Mark as Non-Translatable** | Flag the term so it appears in yellow (source = target)                            |
| **Mark as Translatable**     | Remove the non-translatable flag (shown when the term is already non-translatable) |

## Quick-Add Terms

You can add terms without opening a dialogue:

| Shortcut       | Action                                                                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Alt+Down**   | Quick-add the selected text to all write termbases                        |
| **Alt+Up**     | Quick-add the selected text to the project termbase                       |
| **Ctrl+Alt+T** | Open the Add Term dialog (full control over source, target, and termbase) |
| **Ctrl+Alt+N** | Quick-add the selected text as a non-translatable term                    |

{% hint style="success" %}
Quick-add shortcuts use the currently selected source text and the corresponding selected or clipboard target text. The term is added instantly without opening a dialog.
{% endhint %}

## Font Size

Use the **A+** and **A-** buttons in the TermLens panel header to increase or decrease the font size. Changes apply immediately.

## Tips

* TermLens respects termbase activation –only terms from activated termbases are shown.
* If you have many termbases, designate one as the **Project termbase** (shown in pink) to make its terms stand out.
* Hover over a term to see a tooltip with all translations, synonyms, definitions, and the termbase name.
